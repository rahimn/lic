This thesis would not exist without the extensive guidance of my supervisors Elizabeth Wulcan and Richard Lärkäng. For your persistent support and motivation, for sharing your knowledge and wisdom (in mathematics and in life), and for your patience, I am ever grateful. Thank you also to my friends and colleagues in the complex analysis group for creating a warm and welcoming environment, not only for me but for our many guests and visitors. It is a pleasure to know you all. I would not have gotten this far without my dear friends and peers at the department; to Rickard, Robin, Mattias, Ludvig, Douglas, Rolf, Jan, Julia, Petar, Rémi, and Antonio, to mention only a few, thank you! Finally, I am filled with gratitude to my friends and family for their endless love and support.
